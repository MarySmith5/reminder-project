*Friendly Reminder* is a fullstack web application designed for a small salon owner/operator to store contact information about each customer. The user can then create appointments for the customer. These appointments can be deleted and the details of the appointment can be viewed. The main function of the app is to send three customized reminders of the appointment to the customer. The first one is sent immediately upon setting the appointment. The next is sent one day prior, and the final reminder is sent three hours prior to the appointment.

###### Google Calendar
In a future version, I'd want to integrate the Google Calendars API so that the user could export the appointments directly to a Google Calendar, or import an appointment from a Google Calendar into the reminder app.
